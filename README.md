Autocomplete Fields
======
**Autocomplete Fields** is a collection of fields specifically for autocompletion. Uses typeahead for normal completion, and select 2 for dropdown style autocompletion.

This is an alternative to some other modules that provide similar functionality (I actually didn't find the autocomplete one until later that probably would've suited my needs... Oops! Ah well, you now have a slightly harder option to use in this module...). Main difference, you can apply any option to these fields using data-attributes (similar to how the Twitter Bootstrap JS components work).

If you need a Select 2 Field that acts more similar to the in-built DropdownField, please use [sheadawson/silverstripe-select2](https://github.com/sheadawson/silverstripe-select2)

For an alternative TypeaheadField please use [betterbrief/silverstripe-autocompletefield](https://github.com/BetterBrief/silverstripe-autocompletefield)
